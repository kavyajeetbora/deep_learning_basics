RCNN for object detection

1. Region Proposal

- Selective search for region proposal (clustering)
- it does heirachical clustering at different scales
- Parameter here is the threshold to differentiate similiarities between two colors or regions 

2. Feature extraction
- after proposing the regions, we crop each region and then we resize it for feeding it to the model
- as separate regions
- model is CNN 
- and the output of CNN model is the feature that represents the image 

3. RCNN - classification
Simply after getting the feature extraction of the region (in the form of cropped images)

4. RCNN - regression
In the regression the problem is to minimize the true displacement and the predicted displacement 

5. RCNN - training
- Fine tuning the pretrained CNN model


Demerits - 
The amount of computation is more in R-CNN because for each image there is N number of region proposed.
That means more input is feeded in the deep network and results in more requirement of computation power.


YOLO - You only look once - Object detection technique

- The idea for YOLO is to overcome the regional approach which leads to more number of weigths
- In YOLO the image is divided into S by S grids and each grid is checked for confidence - 
- Confidence of grid containing an object which will be verified with the training data.
- The higher confidence grids will only be retained for further computation and rest will be discarded. 
- In the further computation the (x,y,w,h) will be trained using the training examples and the class that object 
  in the grid belongs to.
